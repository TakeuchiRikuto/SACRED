# SACRED: Scaffold-Constrained ADMET-aware Conditional Encoder-Decoder

## Abstract

We present SACRED, a novel molecular generation framework that combines pre-trained molecular encoders with conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to generate molecules satisfying both scaffold constraints and ADMET property specifications. Unlike existing approaches that rely on post-hoc filtering or simple concatenation of constraints, SACRED integrates multi-modal molecular representations through a hierarchical conditioning mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-constraint molecular generation.

## Key Innovations

1. **Dual-Encoder Architecture**: Combines ChemBERTa for SMILES encoding with Graph Neural Networks for scaffold representation
2. **Hierarchical Conditioning**: Three-level constraint integration (scaffold, ADMET, latent)
3. **Property-Aware Latent Space**: Disentangled latent representation for independent property control
4. **Adaptive Loss Function**: Dynamically weighted multi-objective optimization

## Performance Highlights
